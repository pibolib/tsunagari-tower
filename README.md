# TSUNAGARI TOWER: Phoebe's Ascent

A puzzle game developed by pibolib, originally created for GMTK Game Jam 2022.

Note: This project is completed, and will no longer be actively worked on. See [my site](https://www.pibolib.xyz) or [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pibolib) for information on new projects.

### Required tools

1. Godot 3.5 (this project has NOT been tested with Godot 4 and is unlikely to work well with it)
2. Aseprite (not explicitly required but if you would like to dig through my assets you can with it)

### Notes

1. I do not guarantee code quality. This was a patchwork creation that has been built on over a period of time after its initial codebase was created. The quality of my code has greatly increased since working on this and it is not a good example of my work in this regard.
2. By releasing this code into the public, I provide permission for you to use my *code* as reference in your projects. The assets (art, music, design, etc) and all auxilliary elements are copyrighted intellectual property of pibolib, and cannot be used in external contexts. Feel free to mod away if you find interacting with a horrible codebase to be a desirable prospect, but do **NOT** use my work in your external projects.
